🌿 1️⃣ Introduction to Git Branch

A branch in Git is like a separate copy of your project.

👉 It allows you to work on new features
👉 Without affecting the main project

By default, Git has one branch called:

main


Example:
You want to create a login page.
Instead of changing main directly, you create a new branch.
