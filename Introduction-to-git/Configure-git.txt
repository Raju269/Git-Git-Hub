🔧 What does “Configure Git” mean?

Configuring Git means:

👉 Telling Git who you are
👉 Setting your name and email
👉 So Git knows who made the changes

Without configuration, Git cannot track your identity properly.

✅ Step 1: Set Your Name

Open VS Code terminal or Command Prompt and type:

git
git config --global user.name "Raju Kumar"


This tells Git:
“I am Raju Kumar.”

✅ Step 2: Set Your Email
git config --global user.email "your_email@gmail.com"


Use the same email that you used on GitHub.

Now Git knows:
“This work belongs to this email.”

✅ Step 3: Check Configuration

To see if everything is set:

git config --list


You should see your name and email.

🧠 What does --global mean?

--global means:
✔ This setting works for all projects on your computer
✔ You only need to do it once

🎯 Simple Example

Think like this:

Git = School notebook

Your name/email = Student name on notebook

Commit = Homework submission

If name is not written, teacher (Git) doesn’t know who did the work.
