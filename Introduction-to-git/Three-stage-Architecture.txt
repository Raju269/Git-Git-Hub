📚 Three-Stage Architecture (Database)

It has 3 levels:

1️⃣ External Level (User View)

👉 What the user sees
👉 Each user sees only required data

Example:
A student sees only marks.
A teacher sees marks + attendance.

2️⃣ Conceptual Level (Logical View)

👉 Full database structure
👉 Shows tables, fields, relationships

Example:
Student table → ID, Name, Marks
Teacher table → ID, Subject

It does NOT show how data is stored physically.

3️⃣ Internal Level (Physical View)

👉 How data is actually stored in computer
👉 Storage, indexing, files

User does NOT see this.

🎯 Easy Real-Life Example

Think of it like a building:

External → What visitors see

Conceptual → Building design plan

Internal → Bricks, pipes, wiring inside walls

🔥 In One Line

External = User view
Conceptual = Database design
Internal = Physical storage

Done ✔ Simple and clear.
