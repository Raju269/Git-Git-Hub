📌 What is .gitignore ?

.gitignore is a file that tells Git:

👉 “Do NOT track these files.”

It helps to ignore unnecessary files.

🎯 Why We Use .gitignore ?

Some files should not be uploaded to GitHub, like:

node_modules folder

Temporary files

Log files

Password files

.env file

So we write them in .gitignore.

📂 Example of .gitignore File

Create a file named:

.gitignore


Inside it write:

node_modules/
.env
*.log


Meaning:

node_modules/ → Ignore this folder

.env → Ignore environment file

*.log → Ignore all log files

🧠 Simple Meaning

Git tracks everything.
.gitignore tells Git what NOT to track.

🎓 Easy Example

Think like this:

Git = Teacher
Project files = Homework
.gitignore = List of pages teacher should ignore

🔥 Important Point

If a file is already committed,
adding it to .gitignore will NOT remove it.

You must remove it first:

git rm --cached filename
