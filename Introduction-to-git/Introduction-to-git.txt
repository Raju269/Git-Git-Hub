What is Git?

In the simplest terms, Git is a tool for tracking changes in files over time.

Imagine you are writing a large report or developing a software program. As you work, you constantly save new versions. If you make a mistake later, wouldn't it be great to jump back to a perfect, earlier version? Git does this for you automatically and intelligently.

What is GitHub?

If Git is the powerful software you use to track your changes, GitHub is the website or cloud service where you store, share, and collaborate on those Git-tracked projects.
