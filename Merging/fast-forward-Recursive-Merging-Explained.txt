⚡ 3️⃣ Fast-Forward Merge (Simple)

Fast-forward happens when:

👉 main branch has no new changes
👉 feature branch is ahead

Git just moves main pointer forward.

No extra merge commit created.

Example:

main → A
feature → A → B

After merge:

main → A → B

Command:

git merge feature


It says: Fast-forward

🔁 4️⃣ Recursive Merge (Normal Merge)

Recursive merge happens when:

👉 Both branches have different commits

Example:

main → A → C
feature → A → B

Now Git must combine B and C.

Git creates a new merge commit.

Result:

main → A → C → M

(M = merge commit)

Git automatically combines both histories.

🛠 Fast-forward vs Recursive (Difference)
Fast Forward	Recursive
Only one branch updated	Both branches updated
No merge commit	Creates merge commit
Simple	More complex
