💥 5️⃣ Merge Conflicts

Conflict happens when:

👉 Two branches change the SAME line in SAME file.

Example:

Main branch:

color: blue;


Feature branch:

color: red;


Git gets confused.

🧠 Conflict Looks Like This:
<<<<<<< HEAD
color: blue;
=======
color: red;
>>>>>>> feature


You must manually choose which one to keep.

2️⃣ Remove conflict markers
3️⃣ Keep correct code

git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
