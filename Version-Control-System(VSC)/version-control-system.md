# Git and Version Control System (VCS) Guide

## What is a Version Control System (VCS)?

A Version Control System (VCS) is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It's like a "time machine" for your code, letting you track modifications, revert files back to a previous state, and work on a project with a team without stepping on each other's toes.

## Types of VCS

There are three main types of Version Control Systems:

Local Version Control Systems (LVCS): The simplest form, where all version data is stored on a local machine.
Example: SCCS (Source Code Control System).

## Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)

 A single server (central repository) hosts all the versioned files, and clients check out files from this central place.
Example: Subversion (SVN), Perforce.

## Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)

 Clients don't just check out the latest snapshot of the files; they fully mirror the entire repository, including its full history.

Example: Git, Mercurial, Darcs.
